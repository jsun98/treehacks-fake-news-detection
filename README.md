# treehacks-thermostat
## Project Description
Create a thermostat predicts cost given a user's desired temperature as input. The prediction utilizes weather forcast, energy consumption costs and user preference. A machine learning model would be trainined on open source data to make the prediction. Input and output can be in the form of text (chatbot, web etc.) or voice.

## TODO
- [ ] find a suitable ML library for price prediction
- [ ] determine factors affecting the cost of using air conditioning
- [ ] design input features
- [ ] find data to train the model
- [ ] analyze model prediction accuracy
- [ ] design backend API
- [ ] design chatbot interface (possible integration with Slack?)
- [ ] test

## Tech needed
- MS Azure ML library
  - knowledge based data analysis
  - speech recognition
  - internationalization (optional)
- MS Bot Framework
- Stdlib backend API
